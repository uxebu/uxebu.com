JavaScript Developer

[Patrick Wied](../media/img/team/wied.jpg)

I'm a self taught Web Developer since 2006, that's when I started working for a small Austrian web development company doing full stack client work. A few years ago I started exploring the language specialities of JavaScript and since then I spent most of my time on creating interesting projects (ab)using and pushing the edges of web technologies.

In my spare time I love to read and hack on data visualizations, algorithms, and mathematics.
